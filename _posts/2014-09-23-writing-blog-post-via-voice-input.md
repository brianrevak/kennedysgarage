<p>This past Saturday <a href="https://twitter.com/btrevak">Brian</a> and I had to transcribe some copy for a website that we were building. We had to get copy from a flat image and retype it out. We are talking over 20 pages worth.</p>
<p>Brian had an idea; "why don't we just use the voice to text input on the iPhone?”. I thought it was a great idea and we ran with it. Brian read the copy and pasted it in. It must have saved us hours. I thought about it a little more and I was thinking why don't I just try to <em>write</em> some blog posts by voice to text. Seth Godin says you should <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/09/talkers-block.html">write like you talk</a>. So here I am talking into my iPhone writing this post. I am quite interested to see how this turns out and if I can start producing higher quality posts and more of them.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>I am sure I will get better at this. The copy above was slightly edited, but pretty true to how I spoke it.</p>
